## 🚀 Self-Hosted Quick Start

Self-hosting Vega AI gives you complete control over your data. You only need a Gemini API key to get started.

# Create a directory for Vega AI
mkdir vega-ai && cd vega-ai

# Create a config file with your Gemini API key

```

That's it! No complex setup required.

## 🐳 Docker Options

### ARM64 Support (Apple Silicon)

The Docker images support both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures:

```bash
# Works on both Intel/AMD and ARM processors
docker pull ghcr.io/benidevo/vega-ai:latest
```

### Docker Compose

For easier management, use Docker Compose:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  vega-ai:
    image: ghcr.io/benidevo/vega-ai:latest
    ports:
      - "8765:8765"
    volumes:
      - vega-data:/app/data
    env_file:
      - config
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  vega-data:
```

Then run: `docker compose up -d`

### Docker Swarm

Docker Stack Deploy doesn't read `.env` files ([known limitation](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/29133)). Use one of these approaches:

```bash
# Option 1: Process env file first
docker-compose config | docker stack deploy -c - vega-stack

# Option 2: Export variables manually
export $(cat config | xargs)
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml vega-stack
```

See [docs/DOCKER_SWARM.md](docs/DOCKER_SWARM.md) for detailed instructions.

### Advanced Configuration

- **Docker Secrets**: Use `_FILE` environment variables for secure configuration. See [Docker Swarm deployment](docs/DOCKER_SWARM.md#method-3-using-docker-secrets-recommended-for-production).
- **Development Setup**: Custom ports, SSL, external databases. See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## 🛠️ Development

See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for development setup, testing, and contributing guidelines.
